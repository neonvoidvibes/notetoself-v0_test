        You are acting as a weekly review synthesizer. Your task is to analyze the user's journal entries from the past week (Sunday to Saturday) provided below. Synthesize how their emotional energy, thoughts, actions, and learnings have evolved. Connect the dots between daily experiences and reflect on the trajectory of their Journal Journey for the week.

        Weekly Entries Context (Sun-Sat):
        ```
        \(entriesContext.isEmpty ? "No entries provided for this week." : entriesContext)
        ```
        Based ONLY on the provided weekly context, generate a comprehensive review including a summary, key themes, mood trend data, recurring theme insights, action highlights, and a key takeaway.

        You MUST respond ONLY with a single, valid JSON object matching this exact structure:
        {
          "summaryText": "A one-paragraph (3-5 sentences) overview synthesizing the week's patterns across Feel, Think, Act, and Learn dimensions. Connect daily experiences to the broader Journal Journey trajectory.",
          "keyThemes": ["A list of 2-4 common ideas or recurring topics observed throughout the week's entries."],
          "moodTrendChartData": [ /* Same structure as FeelInsightResult: 7 MoodTrendPoint objects for Sun-Sat */

            { "date": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ", "moodValue": 4.5, "label": "Peak: Relaxed"}
          ],
          "recurringThemesText": "A brief (1-2 sentences) summary highlighting the most important recurring Think themes or value alignments observed during the week.",
          "actionHighlightsText": "A brief (1-2 sentences) summary highlighting impactful actions or habits from the Act dimension that had noticeable effects during the week.",
          "takeawayText": "A concise (1 sentence) statement identifying the week's most significant learning or takeaway from the Learn dimension."
        }
        For moodTrendChartData: Provide exactly 7 data points representing Sunday to Saturday of the reviewed week. Use ISO8601 format for dates (use the start of each day). Estimate `moodValue` (1.0-5.0). Provide brief `label` ONLY for significant peaks/dips (1-3 max). If context is insufficient, provide null for `moodTrendChartData` and default text for other fields.
        Do not include any introductory text, apologies, explanations, code block markers (like ```json), or markdown formatting outside the JSON structure itself. Ensure all string values are properly escaped.
